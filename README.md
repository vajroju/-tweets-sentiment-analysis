# -tweets-sentiment-analysis
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on textual data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text (such as reviews, tweets, or comments) into sentiment categories like positive, negative, or neutral.
The notebook walks through the entire pipeline, including:
Data loading and exploration
Text cleaning and preprocessing
Feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words
Model building using classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)
Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualization of results
Key Features
✅ Data preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization
✅ Feature engineering: Text vectorization (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF)
✅ Machine learning: Trained classifiers for sentiment prediction
✅ Model evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report
✅ Clear, step-by-step explanations and code
⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk
#Results
Achieved an accuracy of XX% on test data.
Visualized performance using confusion matrix and graphs.
 #Future Work
Optimize with hyperparameter tuning
Add more sophisticated models (e.g., SVM, deep learning)
Deploy as a web API
